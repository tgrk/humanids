# HumanIDs

Simple Elixir library that generates human-readable ids from a list of nouns and adjectives. It makes ids easy
for communication with other humans.

Examples:

- dinasaurs-gorillas-20
- swam-burst-48
- abbled-enthusiastically-98
- mongooses-ran-41
- glided-meerkat-98

Even that these ids are reasonably random, it is recommended not to use them as primary ids. Depending on your use-case.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `humanids` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:humanids, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
